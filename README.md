- Single file
- Named `main.go`
- directory should contain `in` and `out` file
- `in` and `out` file should be exactly the same as samples provided by icpc
- Each year has it's own directory, each problem has it's own directory
- In the root directory there is a main_test.go file that works for all tests
- In the root directory there is a main.go file with boilerplate
